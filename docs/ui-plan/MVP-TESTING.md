# MVP Testing Guide

## Console Logging Checkpoints

This document outlines all console log messages you should see during normal operation. Use this to debug the audio pipeline.

---

## 1. Application Start

```

```

---

## 5. Server Response (AI Speaking)

```

### Audio Response:
```
[WEBSOCKET] ‚Üê [AGENT TO CLIENT] { mime_type: "audio/pcm", data: "<base64>..." }
[AUDIO] Converting Base64 to ArrayBuffer, input length: 12000
[AUDIO] ArrayBuffer conversion complete, size: 9000 bytes
[AUDIO] Enqueueing audio to player worklet
[AUDIO] Player buffer: 9000 samples added, fill level: 37%
[UI] State transition: READY ‚Üí SPEAKING
```

### Turn Complete:
```
[WEBSOCKET] ‚Üê [AGENT TO CLIENT] { turn_complete: true }
[UI] Turn complete signal received
[UI] State transition: SPEAKING ‚Üí READY
```

### Interrupt:
```
[WEBSOCKET] ‚Üê [AGENT TO CLIENT] { interrupted: true }
[AUDIO] Interrupt signal - clearing player buffer
[AUDIO] Player buffer reset
[UI] State transition: SPEAKING ‚Üí READY
```

---

## 6. Cleanup (User Ends Session)

```
[UI] User clicked stop button
[AUDIO] üõë Stopping audio recorder...
[AUDIO] ‚úì Source node disconnected
[AUDIO] ‚úì Worklet node disconnected
[AUDIO] ‚úì Media track stopped <device_name>
[AUDIO] ‚úì AudioContext closed
[AUDIO] ‚úÖ Audio recorder stopped and cleaned up

[AUDIO] üõë Stopping audio player...
[AUDIO] ‚úì Player worklet disconnected
[AUDIO] ‚úì Player AudioContext closed
[AUDIO] ‚úÖ Audio player stopped

[WEBSOCKET] üîå Closing connection
[WEBSOCKET] ‚úì Connection closed gracefully
[UI] State transition: READY ‚Üí IDLE
```

---

## 7. Error Scenarios

### Network Disconnect During Conversation
```
[WEBSOCKET] ‚ùå Connection closed unexpectedly
[WEBSOCKET] Close code: 1006 (Abnormal Closure)
[WEBSOCKET] üîÑ Auto-reconnect triggered
[UI] State transition: SPEAKING ‚Üí RECONNECTING
[WEBSOCKET] Retry attempt 1/‚àû in 5000ms...
```

### Audio Buffer Overflow
```
[AUDIO] ‚ö†Ô∏è Player buffer overflow detected
[AUDIO] Oldest samples will be overwritten
[AUDIO] Buffer health: CRITICAL (>90% full)
```

### Worklet Loading Failure
```
[ERROR] ‚ùå Failed to load audio worklet
[ERROR] Error: Failed to load module script...
[UI] State transition: CONNECTING_WS ‚Üí ERROR
```

## Performance Metrics

Monitor these values in console logs:

| Metric | Expected Value | Warning Threshold |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Audio chunk size | ~3200 samples | <1000 or >10000 |
| Buffer send interval | ~200ms | <100ms or >500ms |
| WebSocket latency | <100ms | >500ms |
| Player buffer fill | 10-50% | >80% |
| Memory growth | Stable | +10MB/min |

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: No audio chunks appearing in console
**Solution:**
- Check if mic is muted
- Verify AudioContext state is "running"
- Check browser mic permissions

### Issue: WebSocket won't connect
**Solution:**
- Verify server is running on correct port
- Check CORS settings
- Try ws:// instead of wss:// for local dev

### Issue: Audio plays but sounds distorted
**Solution:**
- Check sample rate mismatch (16kHz vs 24kHz)
- Verify PCM16 conversion
- Check buffer overflow logs

### Issue: State stuck in CONNECTING_WS
**Solution:**
- Check WebSocket URL format
- Verify server accepts is_audio=true parameter
- Check network tab in DevTools

## Debug Commands (Browser Console)

```javascript
// Check AudioContext state
window.audioRecorderContext?.state
window.audioPlayerContext?.state

// Force state transition (if exposed)
window.voiceChatDebug?.setState('READY')

// Check buffer health
window.voiceChatDebug?.getBufferHealth()

// Manually trigger cleanup
window.voiceChatDebug?.cleanup()
```

*Note: Debug commands require exposing refs via window object in development mode*
